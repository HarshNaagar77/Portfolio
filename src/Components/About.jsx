            Hi! I'm <span className=' font-semibold'>Harsh Naagar</span>, a passionate and dedicated Full-Stack Web Developer with a knack for building intuitive and scalable web applications. With a strong foundation in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB, I enjoy transforming ideas into real-world products that solve problems and enhance user experience. <br />
        </p>

        <p className=' text-lg mt-4'>
             Over the past few years, I've worked on a variety of projectsâ€”from dynamic e-commerce platforms to collaborative social apps. I love clean code, efficient architecture, and the thrill of bringing creative concepts to life through code.</p> 

        <p className=' text-lg mt-4'>
                        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or simply sketching out my next big idea.
        </p>
